# What is this talk about?

---
# This is *not* about

- *Agile* dogmas/methodologies.

--

- A tutorial on procedures.

--

- Language/framework specific.

--

- Me lecturing you.

---
# This is an *open discussion*

- What do we understand by testing.

--

- What are the benefits.

--

- What are the costs.

--

- Where are we in terms of testing.

--

- What can we do to improve the current situation.

# What is testing?

(unit testing, integration testing, exploratory testing, usability testing,
performance/load testing, anything!)

---

# Testing

According to Wikipedia:

> Software testing is an investigation conducted to *provide stakeholders with
> information about the quality* of the product or service under test.

--

mmm.... what about tests:

> A test is an *experiment* designed to *reveal information* or answer a
> specific question about the software or system.

--

### tl;dr: make sure the system works as expected.

.big[What are the benefits *from a developer POV*?]

--

- Enable refactoring

--

- Avoid regressions bugs .red[*]

.footnote[ .red[*] Or at least reduce the likelihood of a regression.]

What about this one?

Benefits *from a developer point of view*:

- All the previous benefits plus...

--

- Leads to better design. .red[*]

.footnote[.red[*] More on this in the next slide.]

--

- Inform us where to go next.

--

- Up to date sample code (in form of tests).

--

- Demostrate concrete progress.

--

- It's fun!

## Front-end devs have no idea...
Are you sure? What about a simple "hello world" program?

---

# Homework: *hello_world.py*

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print "Hello, world!"
```

- Is this a good design?
- Is it testable?
- How would you do it?

# Legacy projects

---

# Test-last development

### Before to begin:

--

- What are the unknown/hidden dependencies/pre-requisites?

--

- Are there any specific environment requirements to mock/simulate?

--

- Can we change code?

--

- Is the code testable in its current status?

--

- *Focus on what is possible* rather than what isnâ€™t!

---

# Test-last development

### Creating your tests:

--

- Where to start? pick a bussy code path (most bang for your buck).

--

- Create fixtures for your tests (setup, teardown).

--

- Focus on coverage instead of corner cases (avoid early refactoring).

--

- Group by pathways.

--

- Don't depend on pre-existing data (prepare test data or mock all the things).

--

- Remove dead/unused code.

---

# Ultimately, it's not about us!

---

# Closing thoughts

- Testing is a tool to meassure the quality of the software/library/system.

--

- Without data/reports on the health and status of the project, it is pretty
  hard to take any kind of long-term decision.

--

- We are already testing, manual testing.

--

- Automated testing *is not a big deal*, think of it as leaving footprints as
  you go, so there's no need to repeat yourself by re-doing manual testing.

--

- A reasonable test suite helps/allows refactor and prevent regressions.

--

- Test snippets can be used as a poor's man documentation.

--

- Tests can be used to explore and drive the development (its constraints usually lead to better designs).

--

- No matter what, write testable/quality code is up to you.
